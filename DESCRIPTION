Description:
    Provides R wrappers of several on-target and off-target scoring methods for CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs).
    The following nucleases are supported: Cas9, Cas12a and enCas12a. 
    The available on-target cutting efficiency scoring methods are Azimuth, DeepHF, DeepCpf1 and enPAM+GB.
    Both the CFD and MIT scoring methods are available for off-target specificity prediction. 
    The package also provides a Lindel-derived score to predict the probability of a gRNA to produce 
    indels inducing a frameshift for the Cas9 nuclease. Note that DeepHF, DeepCpf1 and enPAM+GB are not
    available on Windows machines.
